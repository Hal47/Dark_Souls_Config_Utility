  fix: fringe case where rofap + mom + tb ring triggered a hp warning

1.17.0
  fix: (final fix for) kick function. thanks to anyone who provided
       reports for this one - not everyone was crashing (i wasn't)
       so that was a tricky one to fix with no local feedback.
       i am deeply sorry for all these new versions coming out,
       hopefully, we should be able to let it rest for a while now.
       thanks again for your patience.

       locked during multiplayer sessions. nothing should break, still
       do feel free to report back if something is amiss

       this should hopefully mean the end of the namecrash bug in
       all its occurrences and forms. it's been a wild ride, jellybaby
  etc: misc fixes and code speedups
