----------------------Dark Souls Dualshock 4 Interface----------------------

Version: v1.9

IMPORTANT NOTE: These buttons are only applicable if you have an Xinput Wrapper for the Dualshock 4 installed! If you don't have that, then these prompts will not apply to the game!

A recommended Xinput wrapper for the Dualshock 4 is DS4Tool. You can download it here: http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-DS4-To-XInput-Wrapper 

Installation is very easy. Just install the driver, start the application, and click on "Hide DS4 controller".

NOTE: Don't have Steam running when you start the application! If you start Steam beforehand, then the controller won't be recognized.

-----------------------------Installation Instructions----------------------------

Install DSfix and put the two image files (40fbc4ad.png and 43a2b23a.png) in the dsfix/tex_override folder.

-------------------------------------Changelog-----------------------------------

v1.0 

- Initial version

v1.1 

- Fixed D-pads. 

- Replaced more than 50% of Mordhar's icons with my own original icons.

v1.2 

- Many of the icons now have bevels, which make them much more professional-looking and accurate to the original icons.

- Analog sticks now look much closer to the DS4's analog sticks. 

- L3 and R3 button prompts are now named L3 and R3, instead of simply being the same thing as the left stick and right stick icons.

- Face button symbols look much closer to the DS4's face button symbols.

v1.2.1

- Added the start menu icons ripped straight from the PS3 version.

v1.2.5

- Face buttons have been modified to look darker and a bit better.

- Slight modifications have been made to the analog sticks and D-pads.

v1.3

- Made D-pad icons smaller due to them extending past their tile space and being cut off in earlier versions.

- Icons have been modified to be much more readable for people with eyesight problems/low monitor resolutions.

- L3 and R3 button icons have been remade to look more like the original icons.

v1.5

I skipped a version number because of how many changes I made to the icons!

- Color scheme has been modified to increase visibility. 

- Analog stick icons have been heavily redone.

- D-pads are even more improved!

- Face buttons have been modified for better visibility and aesthetic.

- A new font for the shoulder button prompts and analog sticks!

v1.9

- Replaced all of Mordhar's icons. The reason why it's not v2 is because the 3 fire icons are doctored versions of images made by dbszabo1 on DeviantART. These are placeholder for when I eventually make the fire icons myself.

- Small button tiling fixes.

v2

- Perfect tiling on every icon.

- Added the "©" and "® —" symbols just to be safe.

Final Version

v2 was going to be the final version, but as I looked at it, I figured I jumped the gun a bit.

- Better-looking filters for the face buttons, D-pad, and the Share/Options buttons.

- Fixed an alignment issue with the analog stick icons.

------------------------------------Description------------------------------------

This mod replaces the original Xbox 360 button prompts with Dualshock 4 button prompts. The buttons are 2048x2048. The resolution is that high due to downscaling issues, but I'm sure it's great for Ultra-HD monitors.

-----------------------------Plans for future updates---------------------------

Replace dbszabo1's fire images with my own icons.

--------------------------------Why did I do this?-------------------------------

I feel like the Dualshock 4, as a PC gamepad, is much better than a 360 controller due to its comfortability. I made this mod to make using a DS4 in this game feel more official.

---------------------------------------Credit---------------------------------------

These icons were made completely with free, open source software. The software I used is as follows:

Inkscape 0.48 - http://inkscape.org/

GIMP 2.8 - http://www.gimp.org/

Blender 2.7 - http://blender.org/

Some of the icons I replaced Morhar's icons with (namely the fire icons) were images made by dbszabo1 from DeviantART.
