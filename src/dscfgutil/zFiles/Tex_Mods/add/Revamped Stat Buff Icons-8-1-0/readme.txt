SilentRequiem's Revamped HUD Buff Icons

=======================================

This is a texture modification for the various HUD buff icons that appear under your HP/END bar. 

The stock icons seemed really out of place and ugly to me, so the first thing I decided to do when I saw that Durante enabled texture replacement was work to change them. I realized that most of them already had corresponding stat screen icons that either closely or exactly represented their effects. I take no credit for the art, aside from some minor editing, Its all stock!

Enjoy!
