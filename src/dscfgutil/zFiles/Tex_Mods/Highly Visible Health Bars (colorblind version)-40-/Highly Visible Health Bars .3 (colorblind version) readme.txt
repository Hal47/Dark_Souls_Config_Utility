Highly Visible Health Bars (colorblind version)
(a mod for Dark Souls, by AJane)

~~~

What's it do?

I've always had trouble seeing the enemy health bars in both Demon's and Dark Souls, which this mod attempts to address. This is a variant of the previous Highly Visible Health Bars version .3 mod which makes them more readable for colorblind players. Current HP is yellow, just-inflicted damage is blue, and the empty bar is gray.

What's new in HVHB (colorblind version)?

Same as version .3, just with more appropriate colors for colorblind players.

How to install:

Install DSfix 1.2 or later, and make sure to set enableTextureOverride to 1 in dsfix.ini. Copy e3e2582d.png to your data\dsfix\tex_override folder. Squint less.

(DSfix can be found at http://darksouls.nexusmods.com/mods/19)

How to uninstall:

Simply delete, move, or rename e3e2582d.png.

Future plans?

Considering changes to the HUD's health/stamina/boss bars. IMO the main health bar's red HP color and black background are too dark; the black makes it difficult to see just how much of the bar is empty against dark backgrounds.

The latest version will always be at http://darksouls.nexusmods.com/mods/40/
