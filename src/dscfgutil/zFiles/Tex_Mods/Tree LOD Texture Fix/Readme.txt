First, this requires a current version of DSfix in order to function. (1.5 or later)

Once you've installed DSfix, place these .dds images of trees inside the Dark Souls\dsfix\tex_override folder.



This should fix the tree lod bugs. I think I've fixed every tree now.

This functions by replacing the few broken lod textures with full-res textures. It's a very small performance hit, but I doubt that's an issue.
I only have 768mb of vram, and the hit is basically nothing in 99% of the game locations.



If you're updating from a previous version, delete the .png images of trees added by the previous version before installing this new version.
